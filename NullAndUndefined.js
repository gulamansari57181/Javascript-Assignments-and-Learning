/* Infinity is a property of the global object. In other words, it is a variable in global scope.
The initial value of Infinity is Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY. The value Infinity (positive infinity) is greater than any other number.
Two types of global object : Node and Browser window

if we are using node then node is a global object and if we are  using browser
 then browser window is called global object.
  When we deals with backend server with javascript then surely node is global object in that case
